🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting App
Project Overview:
This project analyzes retail sales data and builds a machine learning model to forecast weekly sales across different stores and departments.
A Streamlit web app is provided for interactive predictions, enabling businesses to input store, economic, and promotional details to estimate sales.

🚀 Features:
*  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Insights into sales trends, seasonality, and external factors
*  Feature Engineering – Lag features, rolling averages, markdown promotions, and holiday indicators
*  Machine Learning Model – XGBoost regressor trained for forecasting accuracy
*  Interactive Web App – Built with Streamlit for easy use
*  Reusable Code – Modular notebooks and pipeline for EDA, feature engineering, and modeling
